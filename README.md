### What is this repository for? ###

This is a Pokemon game I built with the purpose of teaching children to code using Java.
The main character can be moved using arrows and the objective is to pick up balls and
throw them at the Pokemon characters. The Pokemon will change into new Pokemon when hit 
until the highest Pokemon is reached. This project requires the application Greenfoot to
run properly.
